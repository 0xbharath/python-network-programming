## Workshop overview

- This workshop explores network programming in the Python language.
- We'll explore networking concepts, protocols and translate these into practical network programming.
- We'll cover basic concepts, modules & third-party libraries in Python to communicate over networks.
- We'll take a bottom-up approach i.e. starting from socket API up until using high level libraries like Requests.
- Difference between Python2.x & Python3.x with regards to network code.

## Concepts covered
- Scripts to communicate over HTTP, DNS, SSH, Telnet, FTP and SFTP.
- Writing simple web scrapers.
- Automating various system administration tasks.(Managing SSH sessions, Querying web services)
- Managing Network data and handling network errors.

## Skill prerequisites

- Basics of Python programming. (strings, lists, dicts, functions, files etc)
- Knowledge of basic networking concepts. (Enough to know what an IP address, port number, OSI model etc.)

## Technical prerequisites
